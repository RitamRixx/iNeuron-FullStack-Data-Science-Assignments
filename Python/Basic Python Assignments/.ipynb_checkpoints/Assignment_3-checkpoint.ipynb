    "#### 1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "**Ans:**  Functions allow you to break down your program into smaller, self-contained modules. Each function performs a specific task, making the overall program more organized and easier to understand. Functions can be reused in different parts of the program or even in other programs, saving time and effort."

    "**Ans:** A function is a defined block of code that encapsulates a specific behavior, while a function call is the point in the program where the function is invoked, and its code is executed with specific arguments. A function can be called multiple times throughout the program with different arguments, allowing for reusability and flexibility."
