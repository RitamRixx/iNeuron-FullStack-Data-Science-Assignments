    "#### 1. What is the primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "**Ans:** The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to organize software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. OOP focuses on manipulating objects that have unique attributes and behavior, making it well-suited for large, complex, and actively updated programs."

    "#### 2. What is an object in Python?\n",
    "**Ans:** In Python, an object is a fundamental concept that represents a particular instance of a class. Objects encapsulate both data (attributes) and behavior (methods) into a single entity."

    "#### 3. What is a class in Python?\n",
    "**Ans:** In Python, a class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. Classes serve as a way to bundle data and functionality together, providing a structure for creating new instances of that type."

    "**Ans:** In Python, class variables and instance variables serve different purposes within classes. Here are the key distinctions between class variables and instance variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.** Class variables are variables that are shared among all instances of a class. They are defined within the class definition but outside of any method. Instance variables are variables that are unique to each instance of a class. They are defined within the class's methods and are prefixed with self to indicate that they belong to a specific instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.** Class variables can be accessed using the class name itself or through any instance of the class.Instance variables are accessed using the instance name and are specific to the individual instance."
